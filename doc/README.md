# AsciiEDoc - EDoc extension for generating HTML or Github-flavored Markdown from AsciiDoc sources #

<p>AsciiEdoc is an Erlang application that integrates AsciiDoc with EDoc
or EDoc with EDown.  This may sound a little crazy at first but the
primary reasons are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Dislike EDoc's primitive wiki support.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Really</strong> dislike having to use XHTML for EDoc purposes.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Not crazy about Markdown either. Markdown is helpful only in one
  sense - GitHub integration.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
AsciiDoc is simple, easy to use, friendly to humans, and yet
  expressive "enough" to produce high-quality documentation.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This documentation flow is a work-in-progress and the error reporting
is fragile when something breaks.  Nevertheless, this documentation
flow may be of interest to others.</p>
<p>For sample AsciiDoc-annotated overview.edoc and Erlang source files,
see UBF and UBF-related repositories on GitHub
(<a href="https://github.com/ubf/ubf">https://github.com/ubf/ubf</a>) for details.</p>

conventions of the Erlang world, and has several features not found in
Javadoc.</p>
